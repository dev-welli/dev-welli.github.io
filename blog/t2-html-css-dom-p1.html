    <h1>T2: Technical Blog part 1</h1>

<p>Browsing the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/">Zen Garden list designs</a> opened my eyes. The design possibilities with CSS are limitless! Some that caught my eyes are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>219: Steel - Its use of Javascript animation is awesome. Really looking forward to dive into Javascripts so I can create this!</li>
    <li>217: Handcrafted - No animation here but I think its use of simple colored rectangles and their placements are beautiful</li>
    <li>101: Punkass - This one is unique. While the others are designed for vertical (top to bottom) medium, this one is for horizontal medium (left to right)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>

<p>Just like the Udacity video describe, if we use the analogy of building a house:</p>
<ul><li>
    HTML is what the house made of, its structure such as walls, doors, windowss, roof etc
</li>
<li>CSS is the design of the house, what it will be looks like, what colours, what shape</li>
<li>DOM is how the house put together. Where that door/window will be connected to or part of, this wall or that wall?</li></ul>

<h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>

<p>The process where you breakdown a webpage design into boxes, big and small. This will make it easier to design the website in a logical way</p>


<h2>What is the box model?</h2>

<p>A layout of page can be represented in boxes, large and small. One or more boxes can be inside another. With CSS you can set its size, potion, and properties such as margins, borders, padding</p>

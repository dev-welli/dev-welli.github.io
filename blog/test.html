              What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              It is completely foreign to me. I never heard the concept of "mindset" before but it completely make sense.

            <div class="answer">
              Now that heard that there are different mindset, I'll try my best to have a creator mindset. 
     Also when Shareef mentioned that "intelligence" as we normally know it i.e. smartness is less important than "emotional" intelligence such as:
     Persistence, humility, empathy, how to tolerate my frustation, the ability to reflect, self awareness/mindfullness, curiosity, integrity and learning to solicit feedback.

              <div class="answer">
                As mentioned, we are used to the customer/restaurant mindset so we need to train ourselves for the creator mindset.
     It's been quite awhile since I've been in the environment of "group learning" so I need to get familiar with how to solicit feedback from my cohorts especially since I am an introvert.

              <div class="answer">
                I don't think so. I expect I would struggle occasionaly in this "new environment" but with the struggle, one can use it as an opportunity to grow careerwise and lifewise (is that a word?).

              Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

            <div class="answer">
               Definitely excited and nervous at the same time. Nervous because it is a huge change from "normal" life but excited for the future!

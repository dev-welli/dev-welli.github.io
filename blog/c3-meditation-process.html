                How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                  I am still not used to it. I followed the process of structuring the site before adding the styles/colors but believe
                  I still used most of the time in rebuilding the website adding/editing the styles
              </p>
              <p>
                  I think I did learnt something though, looking at the css of other sites, trying to emulate them, Googling the solutions etc.
                  My website is still far from finished and I might continue playing around with it if there's time.

                    What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?

            <div class="answer">
              I thought meditation is somekind a mumbo jumbo, a weird thing from "out there". I have friends that 
              swear by it but I never take it seriously

              <div class="answer">
                When you tried to meditate and get distracted, it does not mean you failed. If you tried to refocus 
                to get back to meditate, it is akin to flexing the muscle, train yourself.

                For a noob, and as they said: the simplest is just try to extend the two minute mindfulness exercise from the previous chapter.

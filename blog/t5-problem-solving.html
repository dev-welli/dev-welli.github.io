                  In this sprint #5, I was tasked to count the amounts of blue/green/invisible dots. The doc said that I have to get all the dots in one array
                  and an example is provided but I just could not get my head around it! Spent quite a time rereading the "Events and classes resource", replayed the Youtube videos
                  but still didn't get it so decided to take a break and continue the following day.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The next day, I replayed the video again and see that it uses a Javascript console (with is part of Chrome dev tools) to playaround with Javascript. Not sure whether the console was mentioned on previous EDA chapter(s) but if so, I missed it.
                  By using the console, I can actually check what each line does, what it contains and that gives me more confidence on how to play around with the data and finally finished the task.

                  Pseudocode: pseudocoding a process and what we want the results are is really helpful.

                  Rubber ducky method: I didn't know what "Rubber ducky method" is but after <Strong>Googling</Strong> it I realised that I was using it
                  to solve the "counting dots" task along with <strong>Console.logging</strong> to read the results and <strong>error messages</strong> if they appear.

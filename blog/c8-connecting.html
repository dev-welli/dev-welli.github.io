                <p>
                    I liked the idea about training yourself to build empathy for others. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     I try to give people my full attention when listening to them and maintain eye-contact while in discussion, it helps with communication and trust building. <br>
                     It can be quite hard though if you are not really interested in the subject.

               Try empathic listening - how did it go?

              <p>
                  Empathetic listening is really good, I find it helps in conflict resolution if you 'think' what the other person is feeling.
              </p>
              <p>
                  It makes listening much easier because you feel in touch with what the other person is saying. It can make you understand their point of view when you are viewing it from their perspective and help to foster better interpersonal relationships.

                     I as a Muslim have a standard greeting whenever you meet someone (who also a Muslim as only they understand it): "Assalamu Alaykum" which means "peace be upon you" so in a way, I already practicing to wish someone else to be happy, free form pain and suffering, everyday.

                     A long time ago when I was studying in a uni, I was paired with another student for a project. In the beginning, I worked well with him but then later on, he often missed our scheduled meeting so in the end, I finished the project by myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Without discussing with him, I told my professor about this and in the end I got a sole credit for the project causing him to failed the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                     From my point of view: I was quite annoyed at the time ad felt that it was within my right to report this to the professor.
                </p>
                <p>
                     From his point of view: I didn't discuss this with him and asked what was going on, perhaps he has some personal issue and he was embarassed to up front with me?
                </p>
                <p>
                     In end, our friendship kind a broke after that.

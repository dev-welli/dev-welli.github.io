                What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?

              <p>
                If I understood correctly, they are almost the same or at least very close to each other.
                Mindfulness is trainable and at the same time, your self awareness will improve too.

                Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). 
                What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                  I am not really good at expressing myself either orally or in written form so I chose the body scan exercise.

              <p>
                  Not sure I was doing it correctly but I don't think I feel anything e.g. emotion. I guess that is what it meant
                  by "notice the absence of emotion"?

              <div class="answer">
                I really like it. Don't let emotion define who you are and by acknowledging that emotion is an experience, 
                you can control it, deal with it appropriately.

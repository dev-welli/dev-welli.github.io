    <h1>C2: Emotional Intelligence</h1>

   Based on Chade-Meng Tan's Search Inside Yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, Happiness (And World Peace)


   <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2> 

    <p>I did not realise (before joining EDA) that "Emotional Intelligence" is a thing. I mean I know it is important to be kind, 
        considerate person but I did not know it is imperative to have it  to be succcessful in work and more imporantly in life.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Emotional intelligence is the best predictors of success at work and fulfillment in life</em>
    </p>
    <p>Probably one thing that I took from the chapter is that emotional intelligence 
        is trainable for everyone, something that can be acquired with practice.</p>
 

   <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>

   <p>
       Quite hard. Tried it when reading the chapter 1 but my mind wander and start thinking about other things. 
       I need to keep practicing on it, probably easier at the end of the day before I go to bed.

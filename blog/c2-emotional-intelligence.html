                What learnings did you take from the chapter?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>I did not realise (before joining EDA) that "Emotional Intelligence" is a thing. I mean I know it is important to be kind, 
                    considerate person but I did not know it is imperative to have it  to be succcessful in work and more imporantly in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Emotional intelligence is the best predictors of success at work and fulfillment in life</em>
                </p>
                <p>Probably one thing that I took from the chapter is that emotional intelligence 
                    is trainable for everyone, something that can be acquired with practice.

                <p>
                    Quite hard. Tried it when reading the chapter 1 but my mind wander and start thinking about other things. 
                    I need to keep practicing on it, probably easier at the end of the day before I go to bed.

                <p>
                  I might be lucky that I never had a manager/boss that is not compassionate. By being compassionate, it makes
                  me care more about my performance at the workplace rather than just seing my job as a chore.

              <p>
                  At times, I still find it difficult to meditate (properly), my mind still wonder so need more practice.
                  The idea is certainly good but quite hard to execute.

                <p>
                    Reading the SCARF chapter, I do notice some that come into play during the phase 0 period.
                    Such as Status when I (hopefully) improve some skills.

               Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)

                <p>
                     I think the hardest part of the "difficult conversation" is the beginning, bringing the subject and start
                     the conversation itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Once the conversation started, it flows more easily. There were some tears but it makes us closer.

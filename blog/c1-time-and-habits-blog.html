    <h1>C1: Time and Habits blog</h1>

   Based on <a href="https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/blob/master/resources/nt-time-ARTICLE/README.md">Working with Time</a>

   <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2> 

    Pomodoro technique. 

   <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>

   I struggle with time management and am easily distracted. Tried the Pomodoro technique and it does help with the time management side. No now I need to work on how to concentrate and I think that's where meditation comes in.  

  <h2>What worked for you?</h2>

     For now, the Pomodoro technique.


   <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>

   Next I would like to try meditation and for the ongoing future, looks like the Fogg method and mindfulness can be really useful.

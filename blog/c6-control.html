                When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                When running into a problem when I think I done it right is really frustrating, causes a disproportionate
                emotional response. And as the frustration builds, I start to overlook simpler things and this is when 
                it is a good time to take a break and come back later to tackle the issue or if possible, ask help from someone.
              </p>
              <p>
                One example is when I was doing the Minesweeper task. I could not figure out why the counting cells
                function only returns 1 and the cause was as simple as misplaced "return"

                How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                Although I found it quite difficult to recreate the negative experience, I found the exercise to be useful. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I would imagine that we would  encounter frustation quite often once we hit bootcamp, not that is a bad thing. Hopefully with this technique
                (especially the stop/breathe part) we could overcome it and respond positively.

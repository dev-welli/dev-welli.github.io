    <h1>C1: Reflection blog</h1>

   Based on <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table</a>

   <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2> 

     It is completely foreign to me. I never heard the concept of "mindset" before but it completely make sense.


   <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>

     Now that heard that there are different mindset, I'll try my best to have a creator mindset. 
     Also when Shareef mentioned that "intelligence" as we normally know it i.e. smartness is less important than "emotional" intelligence such as:
     Persistence, humility, empathy, how to tolerate my frustation, the ability to reflect, self awareness/mindfullness, curiosity, integrity and learning to solicit feedback.

  <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>

     As mentioned, we are used to the customer/restaurant mindset so we need to train ourselves for the creator mindset.
     It's been quite awhile since I've been in the environment of "group learning" so I need to get familiar with how to solicit feedback from my cohorts especially since I am an introvert.



   <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>

    I don't think so. I expect I would struggle occasionaly in this "new environment" but with the struggle, one can use it as an opportunity to grow careerwise and lifewise (is that a word?).


   <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>

     Definitely excited and nervous at the same time. Nervous because it is a huge change from "normal" life but excited for the future!

    <h1>C1: Reflection blog</h1>

   Based on https://vimeo.com/85001014

   1. What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?

     It is completely foreign to me. I never heard the concept of "mindset" before but it completely make sense.


   2. What are your impressions?

     Now that heard that there are different mindset, I'll try my best to have a creator mindset. 
     Also when Shareef mentioned that "intelligence" as we normally know it i.e. smartness is less important than "emotional" intelligence such as:
     Persistence, humility, empathy, how to tolerate my frustation, the ability to reflect, self awareness/mindfullness, curiosity, integrity and learning to solicit feedback.

   3. How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

     As mentioned, we are used to the customer/restaurant mindset so we need to train ourselves for the creator mindset.
     It's been quite awhile since I've been in the environment of "group learning" so I need to get familiar with how to solicit feedback from my cohorts especially since I am an introvert.



   4. Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?

    I don't think so. I expect my behind to get kicked :-) often with EDA but I think it is necessary for me to grow careerwise and lifewise (is that a word?)

   5. Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

     Definetely excited and nervous at the same time. Nervous because it is a huge change from "normal" life but excited for the future!
